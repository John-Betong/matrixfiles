This Github Resource can be seen online:

<hr>

#### http://matrixfiles.com. 

The following thread was raised regarding simplifying the above site by using PHP includes.

#### https://www.codingforum.net/forum/server-side-development/php/post-a-php-snippet/2424760-use-php-2-format-menu-link-when-removing-code-to-its-own-page-making-it-an-include

The thread got out of hand and this thread was raised to start rewriting the site using the latest PHP practises:

#### https://www.codingforum.net/forum/client-side-development/general-web-building/2424853-for-judgedredd-homepage-rewrite

Anyway to cut a long story short my efforts have now been made into this resource and the link added to the previous thread.


## Installation:
Clone or download the zip file into a new "matrixfiles" directory or any other directory name name of your choice. 

## Running:
Browse to the directory and the site should render - if and only if Apache2 rewrite has been installed  by using the following apache2 command:

#### sudo a2enmod rewrite && systemctl restart apache2


The site has been completely rewritten and most of the images and content have been downloaded from:

#### http://matrixfiles.com

### Special Notes:

1. validation links at the bottom of the page are dynamic and only work online.

2. All webpages validate according to HTML and CSS w3.org validation services

If on the off-chance errors are found then post message:
