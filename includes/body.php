      <h2>Welcome!</h2>     
            <em>Here are the 4 most important pages in this site. The first one has a video that is 1.5 hrs long with some important information below the video. The second link is to a page that shows you what the masks and PCR tests (swabs) contain. The third link is a page with 4 videos to show you how to travel without getting the PCR test and without wearing the masks (unless you want to wear HOMEMADE masks only). The 4th link is to a page that is a 2.5 hr video that goes over how to exit the Matrix we are all living in.<br />

<p>This site is still under construction.</p>            
      <p>
        Here you will find a culmination of nearly 37 years of research and Life experiences condensed into one site. It has been running without a proper index page for more than 7 years! Yet items have been constantly added behind the scenes with unique URLs to these items plastered all over the internet till this site actually consists of over 165GB of data!
      </p><p>
        When trying to host the entire site, without a proper index page, in Iceland I was told I couldn't since the data didn't seem to be connected to the site itself. So I endevoured to sort this site out once and for all for everyone's benefit. Maybe one day after this site is all finished I will try and go back to that hosting company and try again.... In the meantime enjoy and don't get stuck down a rabbit hole somewhere on here!
      </p><p>
        On a more serious note, if you read everything that is on this site and look at all the images and videos you will come to a much better understanding of the world and the Universe we live in. You will also understand how to cure cancer and most other diseases and come to know that vaccines are the most dangerous thing you can give your child.
      </p><p>
        The personal cost of bringing you this information has been tremendously high, as it has for others with their info. So please treat it with respect. If you find something that you need more data on please don't hesitate to contact me. I will endeavour to respond within 24hrs.
