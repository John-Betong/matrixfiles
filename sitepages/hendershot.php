<h3 style="text-align: center;">What is a fuel less generator?</h3>

<p>All over the world, people live with the idea that it's necessary to burn fuel in order to produce power that we can use. We have been persuaded that we have to buy coal, coke, timber, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, propane etc to burn, so that we can obtain our precious energy.</p>
<p>And yes, it is perfectly true that burning these materials will indeed result in energy. And yes, we need it and we use it in heating, cooling, powering engines etc. But the fact is that we don't necessarily have to burn fuel to get the energy we need to power our devices.</p>
<p>One of the simplest and most efficient ways of producing your own energy is a fuel less generator. The fuel less generator is a device that is understood to function without the need for a wired power source. Strictly speaking, a fuel less generator is not self-powered, but since it doesn't burn fuel of any kind, in everyday language, it can be described as self-powered.</p>

<p>In the same way that a solar panel in sunlight uses no fuel and yet puts out electrical power, a fuel less generator draws energy from the environment and provides us with mechanical power. Actually, power is never "used up", but just converted from one form into another. This is freely available energy that we don't have to buy, but just learn to produce and then use it.</p>

<p>The advantages of fuel less generators:<br>
»&nbsp;A fuel less generator does not need or depend on fuel (petrol 
or diesel) and it has nothing whatsoever to do with solar 
energy, wind energy or inverters.<br>  
»&nbsp;It preserves the safety of our immediate environment from 
noise and air pollution because it is noiseless and smokeless. 
Since it does not use fuel at all - there is no smoke which is 
usually caused by carbon combustion in fuel.<br> 
»&nbsp;The components needed to fabricate it are readily and easily 
available and can be sourced with ease.<br>  
»&nbsp;It can be built to any capacity, depending on the capacity of the 
load we want it to carry.<br> 
»&nbsp;It does not require any mechanical service or maintenance.<br>  
»&nbsp;It is free from current surge or electric shock.<br> 
»&nbsp;It saves a lot of money individual and business owners spend 
on fuel.<br> 
»&nbsp;It is very safe to use, it does not wear or tear and it can work 
non-stop for as long as you want.<br>

<h4 style="text-align: center; padding:0px 0px 10px;">"The greatest invention of the age"</h4>

<p>On February 28, 1928, a man called Lester Hendershot made front-page headlines across the nation with his invention of a "fuel less 
motor".  Hendershot managed to develop power with his device by cutting the earth's magnetic field as our normal generator cuts its own magnetic field.</p>

<img src="hendershot/generator.jpg" class="plate" alt="A hendershot generator"><br>

<p>Not claiming his device to be a perpetuum mobile, Hendershot explained that it was tapping the earth's magnetic field and rotation as its energy source. The Hendershot Device concerns a self-running oscillator.</p>

<p>There are a pair of large air-core coils positioned in a "basket weave" pattern, cylindrical capacitors inside the coils, several high-value capacitors, a couple of standard transformers and a permanent-magnet "buzzer" for a regulator. The two large coils are tuned to resonate with each other.</p>

<p>Lester Hendershot lived in a small house near the railway line in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. He had not been many studies, but he took courses in mechanics at Cornell University. </p>

<p>Hendershot's machine was not actually a motor, but a generator. It developed electricity which could power another motor but did not produce any usable motion itself. The idea for the generator first came to him in a dream in his early twenties. He forgot the idea for several years and was motivated to start working on it to replace the broken motor in his child's toy airplane.</p>
