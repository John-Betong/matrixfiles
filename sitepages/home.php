	<p>
	Here you will find a culmination of nearly 36 years of research and 
	Life experiences condensed into one site. It had been running without a 
	proper index page for more than 10 years! Yet items have been constantly
	 added behind the scenes with unique URLs to these items plastered all 
	over the internet till this site actually consists of over 165GB of 
	data!
	</p><p>

	When trying to host the entire site, without a proper index page, in 
	Iceland I was told I couldn't since the data didn't seem to be connected
	 to the site itself. So I endevoured to sort this site out once and for 
	all for everyone's benefit. Maybe one day after this site is all 
	finished I will try and go back to that hosting company and try 
	again.... In the meantime enjoy and don't get stuck down a rabbit hole 
	somewhere on here!
	</p><p>

	On a more serious note, if you read everything that is on this site 
	and look at all the images and videos you will come to a much better 
	understanding of the world and the Universe we live in. You will also 
	understand how to cure cancer and most other diseases and come to know 
	that vaccines are the most dangerous thing you can give your child.

	The personal cost of bringing you this information has been 
	tremendously high, as it has for others with their info. So please treat
	 it with respect. If you find something that you need more data on 
	please don't hesitate to contact me. I will endeavour to respond within 
	24hrs.
